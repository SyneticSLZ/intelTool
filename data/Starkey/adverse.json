MY HEARING HAD WORSENED SINCE I HAD COVID IN OCTOBER. I USE JUST ONE HEARING AID BECAUSE THE OTHER EAR CANNOT BE HELPED WITH ONE AND REMAINS TOTALLY DEAF. AFTER TESTING ME AGAIN (B)(6) TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NEED A NEW HEATING AID. HE SAID MY CURRENT HEARING AID HAD TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS OUTDATED WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND THAT HE COULD NO LONGER GET INTO HIS COMPUTER TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE. HE TOLD ME THAT HEARING AIDS NEED TO BE REPURCHASED EVERY 3 TO 4 YEARS DUE TO SWIFT CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. I ASKED HIM HOW SENIORS COULD AFFORD TO SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY THAT OFTEN AND HE TOLD ME THAT MOST RECENTLY PEOPLE WERE USING THEIR (B)(6) INSURANCE MONEY. WHEN I PURCHASED THIS FROM (B)(6) IN 2018, I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS BUYING A STATE OF THE ART HEARING AID THAT COULD BE ADJUSTED AS NEEDED. SINCE THIS EVEN I HAVE RESEARCHED AUDIBEL FURTHER AND FOUND OUT THE FOLLOWING. AUDIBEL SELLS A \"CLOSED SYSTEM\" THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN GET INTO TO UPDATE CHANGING HEARING NEEDS IN THE FUTURE THUS LOCKING SENIORS INTO FALSELY CREATED OBSOLESCENCE AT THEIR WHIM. EVEN THOUGH THEIR PUBLISHED \"PLATINUM CARE PROMISE\" ASSURES BUYERS THAT THEY \"CREATE A LONG-TERM TREATMENT PLAN, DEFINING FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS, REGULAR ONGOING EVALUATIONS AND ANY ADDITIONAL CARE THAT YOU MAY NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY SATISFIED WITH YOUR HEARING IN THE YEARS TO COME.\" AS A RETIRED SENIOR I CAN'T AFFORD A NEW HEARING AID EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS. PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO REQUIRE THIS COMPANY TO SERVICE ITS PRODUCTS. ALSO THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE UP FRONT THEIR PLANNED 3 TO 5 YEAR OBSOLESCENCE TO CONSUMERS. THANKS."

THIS CHARGER HAS AN INTERNAL BATTERY CHARGED BY 5-VOLT POWER SUPPLY. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED SINCE THE BATTERY CELL AND HEARING AID CHARGER ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED/MELTED. THE ANALYSIS OF INCIDENT BATTERY CELL SUGGESTS THAT AN ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUIT IN BATTERY ITSELF LIKELY INITIATED THE THERMAL RUNAWAY EVENT RESULTING IN MELTING OF HEARING AID CHARGER. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SYSTEMIC ISSUES WITH BATTERIES USED IN THESE HEARING AID CHARGERS AND NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE HEARING AID CHARGERS IN USE WITH CUSTOMERS ARE AT ANY RISK OF RESULTING IN A SIMILAR EVENT AS OBSERVED IN THE REPORTED EVENT."

          "text": "THE DATE REFERENCED IS THE DATE OF MY LAST AUDIOGRAM AFTER HAVING WORN HEARING AIDS FOR 16 YEARS. ON THAT DATE MY HEARING DISABILITY WAS A 105 DECIBEL LOSS IN THE LEFT EAR AND A 95 DECIBEL LOSS IN THE RIGHT. THE LEFT EAR CAN NO LONGER BE REMEDIATED WITH A HEARING AID. I AM CONSIDERED DEAF, WAS APPROVED FOR SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY BECAUSE OF MY DEAFNESS ON THE FIRST APPLICATION WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY AND AM A CANDIDATE FOR TWO COCHLEAR IMPLANTS. I WAS A NYC HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER FOR 25 YEARS. I WORE HEARING AID-S- FOR 16 OF THOSE 25. WHEN I STARTED WEARING ONE HEARING AID IN THE LEFT EAR IN 1990, I HAD A MODERATE HEARING LOSS, 40DB OR SO, AND NO LOSS IN THE RIGHT EAR. IN 1992, I STARTED COMPLAINING ABOUT DIFFICULTY HEARING OVER BACKGROUND NOISE IN THE CLASSROOM AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE SCHOOL STUDENT CAFETERIA WHICH, ACCORDING TO A STUDY, AVERAGES 100 DB. MY DOCTORS AND AUDIOLOGISTS TOLD ME ONLY INDUSTRIAL NOISE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE. THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY WRONG. MY HEARING LOSS IS CONSISTENT WITH NOISE INDUCED HEARING LOSS WHICH OCCURS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. I WENT FROM WEARING ONE AID TO TWO. HENCEFORTH, I KEPT GETTING STRONGER HEARING AIDS AND KEPT STEADILY LOSING MORE HEARING. NO ONE TOOK MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT HEARING OVER BACKGROUND NOISE SERIOUSLY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT I KEPT LOSING MORE AND MORE HEARING. IN 1997, AFTER HIRING AN ATTORNEY, I RECEIVED AN ADA ACCOMMODATION OF A TRANSFER TO A SMALL CLASSROOM BUT IT WAS NEVER EFFECTED BECAUSE MY EMPLOYER DID NOT TAKE MY HEARING LOSS SERIOUSLY. I MADE THE DECISION TO CONCENTRATE ON TEACHING WELL RATHER THAN FIGHTING WITH MY SUPERIORS. I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA I WAS AT A HIGH RISK FOR MORE HEARING LOSS ALL OF THIS TIME. NOT ONE PROFESSIONAL INTERVENED. I JUST HAD A REALLY BAD FEELING ABOUT THE BACKGROUND NOISE AND GREAT DIFFICULTY HEARING. I WAS FORCED TO RETIRE ON DISABILITY IN 2005. MY FORMER EMPLOYER WON'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR COMPLICITY IN CONTRIBUTING TO MY HEARING LOSS BY NOT PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE ACCOMMODATION, EVEN THOUGH LABOR LAW SAYS THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING MY HEARING ON A YEARLY BASIS AFTER NOTING A DECIBEL LOSS OF OVER 25 DB. EVENTUALLY, ONE DOCTOR IN ENT ADMITTED VERBALLY THAT WHAT MOST LIKELY HAPPENED WAS THAT MY HEARING AIDS FURTHER DAMAGED MY HEARING, ESPECIALLY WHEN I EVENTUALLY WORE ONE AT 95+ DECIBELS, BUT ADDED THAT I HAD TO WEAR THEM. WRONG. DR ALSO TOLD ME, HIS AUDIOLOGIST TOLD HIM NOT TO PUT THAT IN WRITING. FIRST DR, AS WELL AS MY EMPLOYER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THEIR MEDICAL BOARD AND THE MEDICAL BOARD OF THE TEACHERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM, ALL CHOSE TO IGNORE DOSIMETER READINGS CONDUCTED BY ME IN THE SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM SHOWING TWA DECIBEL LEVELS OF 80-90 DBS. WITH PEAKS OF 148 DB NEEDLES TO SAY, I NO LONGER USE DRS AND NO LONGER TEACH. THE BOTTOM LINE: HEARING AIDS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE IN SOUND ENVIRONMENTS WITH EXCESSIVE NOISE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT TOTALLY IN THE CANAL AIDS, SUCH AS I WORE, LIKE EAR PODS, CAUSE EVENT MORE DAMAGE BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY OF ENHANCED SOUND TO THE AUDITORY NERVE. I DID NOT LOSE MY HEARING BY OSMOSIS AND I HAVEN'T LOST ANY MORE HEARING SINCE I AM RETIRED AND LIVING IN A VERY QUIET PLACE. THERE IS AN FDA CAUTION IN CFR 21, SEC. 801.420, WARNING TO HEARING AID DISPENSERS, VIII: \"SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN SELECTING AND FITTING A HEARING AID WHOSE MAXIMUM SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL EXCEEDS 132 DECIBELS BECAUSE THERE MAY BE RISK OF IMPAIRING THE REMAINING HEARING OF THE HEARING AID USER.\" THE 132 DB NUMBER CANNOT BE RIGHT. THE AUDIOMETRIC SCALE FOR SPEECH SOUNDS STOPS AT 130 DB. HEALTH MINISTRATION CONSIDERS ANYTHING OVER 90 DB DANGEROUS. EPA'S LEVEL IS 70 DB. DATES OF USE: 1990 - 2005. DIAGNOSIS OR REASON FOR USE: MODERATE HEARING LOSS, SEVERE HEARING LOSS, PROFOUND. EVENT ABATED AFTER USE STOPPED: YES."
