ON (B)(6) 2024, (B)(6) OBTAINED A NEWER PHONAK HEARING AID, MODEL AUDEO L50 R AND AUDEO L50L FROM (B)(6) CA. THE MODEL WE AS PARENTS HELPED HER PURCHASE IS A NEWER MODEL FROM PHONAK WITH MORE FEATURES AS WE WERE TOLD. SHE HAS BEEN WEARING HEARING AIDS FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS. ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, MY WIFE WHILE CHECKING THE HEARING AIDE NOTICED THE FILTER FOR THE LEFT EAR WAS MISSING. SHE BECAME ANXIOUS AND CHECKED THE BOX AND COULDN'T LOCATE THE TINY PLASTIC(ACRYLIC) FILTER. THEN MY WIFE ASKED ME TO GO TO HEARUSA IN (B)(6) TO FIND OUT IF HEARING AID PROVIDER COULD CHECK MY DAUGHTER'S EARS. WHEN I WENT TO (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 2024, I COULD ONLY MEET WITH THE RECEPTIONIST, DESTINY WHO EXPLAINED HOW THE FILTER NEEDS TO BE PUT IN AND SHE MENTIONED HEARING AID PROVIDER NOT AVAILABLE THEN AND I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN APPOINTMENT FOR THE (B)(6) 2024. YESTERDAY, WHEN MY WIFE TOOK MY DAUGHTER TO THE HEARING AID DISPENSER MR (B)(6) SAW MY DAUGHTER'S LEFT EARS AND NOTICED THAT THE TINY ACRYLIC FILTER HAS BEEN LODGED WITHIN THE EAR WAX INSIDE THE EARS AND SAID MY DAUGHTER NEED TO BE TAKEN TO MEDICAL DOCTOR TO HAVE THAT PIECE REMOVED. (B)(6) MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND SAID HE WILL DEFINITELY SHARE THIS CONCERN WITH HEARING AID PROVIDERS IN (B)(6), CA WHERE WE OBTAINED THE DEVICE. HE ALSO ASKED US TO CALL PHONAK CUSTOMER SERVICE. ACCORDINGLY, MY WIFE WAS NOT ABLE TO SECURE AN APPOINTMENT WITH (B)(6) PRIMARY DOCTOR BUT WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN AN URGENT APPOINTMENT WITH (B)(6) WITH DR (B)(6). DR (B)(6) WAS NOT ABLE TO REMOVE THE ACRYLIC PIECE LODGED IN THE EAR WAX AND HE IMMEDIATELY REFERRED TO ENT AS A STAT. AS OF THIS WRITING WE THE PARENTS ARE STILL WAITING FOR (B)(6) TO CALL US WITH IMMEDIATE AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT. EARLIER I CALLED PHONAK CUSTOMER SVS AND TALKED TO MR (B)(4) WHO HEARD THE WHOLE SITUATION AND SAID HE ALSO IS NOT AWARE OF THIS KIND OF SITUATION AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO USE A \"DOME\" TO PROTECT THE FILTER. I MENTIONED TO (B)(4) THAT I WILL REPORT THE SITUATION TO FDA. LATER, I CONTACTED (B)(6) AT HEARUSA ABOUT PHONAK CONVERSATION AND HE MENTIONED THAT THIS DEVICE DOES NOT USE \"DOME\" AND USES HARD ACRYLIC PIECE AS FILTER ONLY. THIS SITUATION IS POSING A SERIOUS HEALTH SITUATION FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS MULTIPLE IMPAIRMENTS (HEARING, SPEECH, VISION AND COGNITIVE) AND SO NOT IN A POSITION TO COMMUNICATE HER HEALTH NEEDS. I HAD MENTIONED TO (B)(4) AT PHONAK THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE CAREFUL IN MARKETING THESE DEVICES WITH A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE LIKE THE FILTER FALLING OFF OR GETTING STUCK WITH THE EAR MOLD."

DURING THE NEXT VISIT TO HCP FOR LYRIC REPLACEMENT, THE STATE OF THE EAR HAS WORSENED. ON (B)(6) 2022, THE PATIENT HAS VISITED OTOLARYNGOLOGIST, WHO CLEARED THE DEBRIS, AND CONCLUDED THAT THE EAR CANAL HAS ERODED THROUGH CARTILAGE TO THE BONE, AND THE TISSUE WAS NECROTIC. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED BY THE OTOLARYNGOLOGIST WITH EXTERNA AUDITORY CHOLESTEATOMA, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE OTOLARYNGOLOGIST WAS CAUSED BY THE USE OF LYRIC.

AUDIOLOGICAL TESTING REVEALED CHANGES TO THE AUDIOGRAM AND THESE SYMPTOMS ARE YET TO BE RESOLVED. AUDIOLOGICAL TESTING CONDUCTED ONE MONTH AFTER THE REPORTED EVENT INDICATED HEARING LOSS AS SEVERE-TO-PROFOUND LOSS, WHEN PREVIOUSLY IT WAS CONSIDERED MILD-TO-MODERATE. THE PATIENT ALSO HAD DECREASE IN WORD RECOGNITION SCORES COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RESULTS. HE REPORTED \"CONTINUING PAIN\". SUBSEQUENT TESTING ANOTHER MONTH AND A HALF LATER INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT'S AUDIOGRAM PRESENTED AS A MODERATE LOSS, SHOWING SOME RECOVERY SINCE THE EARLIER VISIT. THE AUDIOLOGIST REPORTS THAT THE PATIENT'S WORD RECOGNITION SCORES ALSO IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE EARLIER SESSION.

DURING THE SERVICE WAX, DEBRIS AND MOISTURE (SWEAT) WERE FOUND. ELECTRONIC MODULE AND HOUSING WERE REPLACED. THE DEVICE WAS CHECKED, CLEANED AND TESTED. IN THE SERVICE REQUESTS FROM MARCH-2022, THE HCP ASKED TO CHECK THE DEVICE AFTER LOUD SOUND WAS REPORTED BY THE USER DURING INTERACTION WITH A SECURITY GATE. NO EVIDENT ADVERSE EVENT OR HARM TO THE PATIENT WERE REPORTED AT THE TIME IN THE SERVICE REQUEST FORM. DEVICE TESTING: PHONAK SKY B-UP IS COMPLIANT, AMONG OTHERS, WITH STANDARDS FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY FOR EMISSION AND IMMUNITY: ETSI EN 301 489-1 V2.2.0 ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY (EMC) STANDARD FOR RADIO EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES; HARMONIZED STANDARD COVERING THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE 3.1(B) OF THE DIRECTIVE 2014/53/EU AND THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE DIRECTIVE 2014/30/EU PART 1: COMMON TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS; ETSI EN 301 489-3 V2.1.1 PART 3: SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR SHORT RANGE DEVICES (SRD) OPERATING ON FREQUENCIES BETWEEN 9 KHZ AND 246 GHZ, HARMONIZED STANDARD COVERING THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE 3.1(B) OF DIRECTIVE 2014/53/EU; IEC 60601-1-2 MEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT - PART 1-2: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BASIC SAFETY AND ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE - COLLATERAL STANDARD: ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCES - REQUIREMENTS AND TESTS, 4TH EDITION AND IEC 60118 PART 13: ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY (EMC) 4TH EDITION. THEREFORE, DEMONSTRATING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE AGAINST SITUATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS ADVERSE EVENT. RISK FILE REVIEW: AT THE TIME THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING, THE EXACT ROOT CAUSE AND DEVICE PROBLEM ARE NOT CONFIRMED AND DETERMINED YET. HOWEVER, RISKS DESCRIBING THE DELIVERY OF TOO HIGH SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL INTO THE EAR HAVE BEEN ALREADY CONSIDERED IN THE CORRESPONDING RISK FILE AND DEVICE'S DESIGN. DEVICE RETURN FOR ANALYSIS: THE ORIGINAL DEVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS AS IT WAS SERVICED AND COMPONENTS WERE REPLACED IN 2022. NEXT STEPS: FOLLOW UP WITH THE HCP AND PATIENT'S LAWYER INITIATED TO CLARIFY THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND THE REPORTED HEALTH SYMPTOMS."

I HAVE EXPERIENCED REPEATED FAILURES OF THE PHONAK NAIDA HEARING AID SINCE FIRST BEING FITTED WITH IT IN (B)(6)  2012. AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT MFR, MY COCHLEAR IMPLANT AUDIOLOGISTS, AND WITH MY HEARING AID AUDIOLOGIST, I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE PHONAK NAIDA UTILIZES AN INTERNAL WIRELESS (ICOM) CONNECTIVITY FREQUENCY THAT IS SO CLOSE IN SPECTRUM TO THAT BEING UTILIZED BY THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT TRANSMISSION COIL, THAT THE HEARING AID FUNCTIONS ARE BEING RANDOMLY INTERFERED WITH ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IT APPEARS THAT, SINCE THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT TECHNOLOGY RADIO TRANSMISSION COIL AND IMPLANTED RECEIVER TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN IN USE FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, THAT THE PHONAK DEVICE IS THUS INCOMPATIBLE FOR USE CONTRALATERALLY ON AN EXISTING COCHLEAR IMPLANT USER. THIS CONFLICT IN USE WAS NOT AND CURRENTLY IS NOT BEING PROPERLY DISCLOSED BY (B)(4) PRIOR TO SELLING THESE (B)(6) DEVICES. THE FREQUENCY ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO (B)(4) AND PERHAPS TO OTHER ICOM TECHNOLOGY DEVICES WOULD APPEAR TO BE INAPPROPRIATE DUE TO SUCH INTERFERENCE WITH EXISTING COCHLEAR IMPLANTS."

EACH TIME THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN MOISTURE INTRUSION CAUSED BY SWEAT. THERE WAS NOT ANY WARNING THAT SWEAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM WHEN I PURCHASED THE INSTRUMENTS. ALMOST EVERY TIME THE UNITS ARE RETURNED FOR REPAIR, THEY REPLACE ALL THE ELECTRONICS. PHONAK MAKES HEARING AIDS THAT ARE WATER RESISTANT AND ARE EQUAL IN PRICE TO THE ONES I PURCHASED AND HAVE REQUESTED THAT THEY REPLACE MY CURRENT INSTRUMENTS WHEN THEY ARE RETURNED FOR REPAIR. THE COMPANY SAID THEY WILL REPAIR MY HARING AIDS BUT WILL NOT REPLACE THEM WITH WATER RESISTANT ONES. THEY DO NOT OFFER LOANS. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE \"LOANER HEARING AIDS\" WHILE MY INSTRUMENTS ARE IN FOR REPAIR. THERE HAVE BEEN 16 WEEKS IN THE 3 LAST TWO YEARS THAT I DID NOT HAVE MY HEARING AIDS AVAILABLE TO ME TO HEAR WITH. THIS IS A GREAT LOSS WHEN YOU ARE HEARING IMPAIRED. THE PRICE OF THE HEARING AIDS WAS (B)(6) NOT COUNTING THE ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES PURCHASED (ICOM ((B)(6)), MY PILOT (B)(6), DRYING CASE ((B)(6)). I WONDER IF IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I COULD GET A REFUND SO THAT I COULD PURCHASE NEW HEARING AIDS THAT ARE MORE RELIABLE, IF NOT COULD THEY AT LEAST EXCHANGE FOR THE WATER RESISTANT MODEL."

IT IS ALSO UNKNOWN IF THE PATIENT WAS USING THE DEVICE DUE TO UNILATERAL HEARING LOSS, AUDITORY SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) OR AUDITORY PROCESSING DISORDER (APD). ANALYSIS OF THE SERVICE HISTORY SHOWED THAT DEVICES WERE REPLACED ONCE TO A NEW SET OF DEVICES DUE TO NOT FUNCTIONING. THE MANUFACTURER HAS NOT RECORDED ANY OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION OR PSYCHOLOGICAL OR EMOTIONAL HARM IN GENERAL FOR THIS DEVICE. ADDITIONALLY, NO EVIDENCE OF CASUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEARING AIDS AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEPRESSION OR SUICIDAL THOUGHTS EXIST IN THE LITERATURE. IN CONTRAST, USING HEARING AIDS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION AND SOME STUDIES DEMONSTRATED REDUCTION IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. DEVICES WERE SERVICED/REPLACED AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS.
